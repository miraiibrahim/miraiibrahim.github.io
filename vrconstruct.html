                <p>This project was created with two main purposes in mind. Firstly, to create a proofof-concept application of the building Flamman in VR and preserving its cultural heritage. Secondly, to ensure a pleasant User Experience (UX) by creating a believable and immersive experience. Cultural heritage and the preservation of old and forgotten environments is important, especially as cultural aspects and tradition are at risk of disappearing. By giving people the opportunity to visit a place of historical value, they can feel connected to the specific time and take part in an enriching experience. </p>

            To bring the Flamman cinema back to life, we started to research the cinema's rich history, studying its architecture and cultural significance to gain a comprehensive understanding of its essence. Using this research, we formulated a solid plan for the VR experience and began creating 3D models and textures of the cinema to bring it to life in a digital format.

            Since this project was focused on UX design, we knew that testing and iteration were key to ensuring a seamless and immersive experience for users. We conducted multiple user tests and made iterative improvements based on feedback. All of this was done with the goal of bringing the Flamman cinema to a wider audience, letting them experience the magic of this cultural treasure in a whole new way.
