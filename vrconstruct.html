                <p>This project was created with two main purposes in mind. Firstly, to create a proofof-concept application of the building Flamman in VR and preserving its cultural heritage. Secondly, to ensure a pleasant User Experience (UX) by creating a believable and immersive experience. Cultural heritage and the preservation of old and forgotten environments is important, especially as cultural aspects and tradition are at risk of disappearing. By giving people the opportunity to visit a place of historical value, they can feel connected to the specific time and take part in an enriching experience. </p>
