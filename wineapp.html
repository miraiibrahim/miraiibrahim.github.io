                <p>Note the Notes is a unique wine tasting app that offers a gamified experience while also being educational, entertaining,
                    and engaging. The app takes care of all aspects of wine tasting and removes the stress of planning an event with friends.
                    The app promotes responsible drinking by avoiding time limits and pressures during the quiz. 
                    To progress in the game, users must actively participate, and all players must be ready. During the game session, 
                    the app asks  users to choose an answer from a list of options., such as selecting the correct wine notes from a list, 
                    ranking them from most to least expensive, and identifying the price, origin, and grape of the wine.
                     The user with the highest number of correct answers receives the highest score and wins the game. 
                     At the end of the session, the app determines who the ultimate sommelier is and who is a wine-newbie.  
                     Break the mobile bubble through competition and fun along with a collaborative
                     asynchronous activity. A fun twist on the traditional wine night! </p>
