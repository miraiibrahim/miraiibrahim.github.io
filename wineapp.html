                <p> Note the Notes is a wine tasting app, where a friend group can plan an event together where no one need to know the wines in advance. 
                    Usually if a group plans a wine tasting, someone needs to host the event and know all the wines and potential questions in advance. 
                    Note the notes is a gamified version of traditional wine tasting and prepares all aspects for you.
                    Arranging a potluck, this app provides the entertainment and the drinks for the evening.  
                    Note the notes is educational, entertaining, and engaging.
                    It takes the stress away from planning an event with your friends.
                    The app promotes responsible drinking. 
                    For example, there are no time limits or time pressures during the quiz. 
                    Users can only move forward in the game by active interaction, and all players must be ready. 
                    
                    During the game session, the application will, for example, ask the users to pick out the right wine notes from a list,
                    rank them from most to least expensive, the price of the wine, origin country, and grape. 
                    The user with the most correct “answers” will get the highest score and win. 
                    At the end of the game, the app will tell you who’s the ultimate sommelier and who’s the wine-newbie.   </p>
