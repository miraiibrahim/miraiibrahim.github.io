                <p>Recovering from eating disorders is an incredibly stressful and uncertain journey, riddled with anxiety
                  and questioning oneself. A recovery journey is substantially deeper than just eating and reaching
                  healthy physiological measures, the psychological aspects seldom go away. There are a lot of recovery
                  applications, but they are mostly focused on tracking meals and logging feelings. These recovery
                  applications are missing the important emotional aspect of both pre and post meal related anxiety. We
                  see a need for something physical and more personal that acts as a companion during
                  mealtimes, focusing on reducing anxiety and negative associations to eating.
                  In this project, we have created a device that we hope will culminate these purposes in everyday
                  experiences, with the help of its aesthetic and functionality. </p>

                    <p>It was hard to conduct all the desired tests and analyses due to limited time. Additionally, Because of the sensitive nature of the project, some tests required the presence of a professional, which was hard to find. Another challenge was the shortage of suitable materials for the device's construction, which forced us to explore alternative options. </p>
