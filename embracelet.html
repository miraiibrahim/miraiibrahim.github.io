                        • Social signifier: creating a signifier that is distinguishable to people with colour blindness.
                        • Finding good material and fastenings: selecting a material that were transparent enough to allow light to shine through, non-conductive, and durable enough to withstand a nightclub environment.
                        • Working with Arduino: getting used to a new software environment is always hard which meant a lot of time had to go into learning the software before actually developing the prototype.

            The ideation methods used in this project were the 6-3-5 method, Crazy 8 method, and discussions with peers to refine ideas. The 6-3-5 method was used to generate ideas initially. Crazy 8 was used to visualize the ideas generated from the 6-3-5 method and refine the concept, resulting in a bracelet.
