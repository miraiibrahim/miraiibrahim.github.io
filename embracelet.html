                <p> Picture this: you're at a nightclub, eager to mingle and make new connections. However, the fear of intruding on others who are there to savor the night with their own group or in solitude, gnaws at you. We've all experienced that cringe-worthy sensation when an unwanted stranger comes our way. Yet, there are those chance encounters that light up the night and leave us feeling ecstatic.
                    Enter Embracelet, the solution to all your clubbing woes. With Embracelet, you can signal your openness to socialize with strangers even before initiating contact, ensuring the most incredible club experience for everyone involved. Say goodbye to awkward interactions and hello to unforgettable moments of connection.

                        • Social signifier: creating a signifier that is distinguishable to people with colour blindness.
                        • Finding good material and fastenings: selecting a material that were transparent enough to allow light to shine through, non-conductive, and durable enough to withstand a nightclub environment.
                        • Working with Arduino: getting used to a new software environment is always hard which meant a lot of time had to go into learning the software before actually developing the prototype.

            For this project, we brainstormed and ideated using a variation of  methods: Crazy8, the 6-3-5 method, Crazy 8 method, and storyboarding. We started with crazy8 to generate a number of creative ideas. 
            Then, we brought our favorite ideas to life using the wacky and wild Crazy 8 method, 
            which helped us refine our concepts and ultimately resulted in the embracelet concept.
            After conceptualizing the idea it was time to develop it. 
            That meant sketching out the main components, creating some low-fidelity prototypes to work out the logistics and finally moving on to
           actually devloping it.
